     Theoretical:

        What are services?
            Is component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations without needing to
            interact with the user.

        Differences between Service and IntentService
            Service, the service run inside the UI thread, it requires that you create a working thread to execute its
            work.

            IntentService, is a subclass of Service, that simplifies your work. It works already in a working
            thread, and can receive asynchronous request. So, you don't need to create ir manually, or to
            be worried about synchronization. You can simply extend it and override the method:

                                     onHandleIntent(Intent intent)

            where you can manage all the incoming request.

        Difference between Unbound Service and Bound Service

            Bounded Service

                A service is bound when an application component binds to it by calling bindService().
                A bound service offers a client-server interface that allows components to interact
                with the service, send requests, get results, and even do so across processes with
                interprocess communication (IPC).

                When the last client unbinds from the service, the system destroys the service EXCEPT
                If the service was started by startService

            Unbounded Service or Started

                A service is started when an application component, such as an activity,
                starts it by calling startService(). Once started, a service can run in the background
                indefinitely, even if the component that started it is destroyed.
