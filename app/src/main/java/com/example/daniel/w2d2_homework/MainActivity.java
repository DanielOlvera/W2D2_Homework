     Theoretical:

        What are services?
            Is component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations without needing to
            interact with the user.

        Differences between Service and IntentService
            Service, the service run inside the UI thread, it requires that you create a working thread to execute its
            work.

            IntentService, is a subclass of Service, that simplifies your work. It works already in a working
            thread, and can receive asynchronous request. So, you don't need to create ir manually, or to
            be worried about synchronization. You can simply extend it and override the method:

                                     onHandleIntent(Intent intent)

            where you can manage all the incoming request.
